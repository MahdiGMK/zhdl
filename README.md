# GOALS
1. simulation should be as fast as possible (using accelerated cpu and/or gpu instruction)
2. you should be able to easily express your zig code, with a minimal change you will be able to convert it to synthesizable zhdl code.
3. all types would match their circuit counter part, so ptr-deref is prohibited

# NON-GOALS
1. general-purpose HLS
